# Portfolio

This homework was to make a responsive portfolio page using bootstrap framework.

All three pages in my portfolio have the same responsive navbar and sticky footer.

The about me page will eventually include information and a picture of myself.

The contact me page uses a form for visitors to input their personal information to submit to me.

The portfolio page only has placeholder images now, but will eventually have working links to my projects I will create.
